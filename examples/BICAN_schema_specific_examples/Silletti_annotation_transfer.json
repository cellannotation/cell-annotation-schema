          "comment": "We performed PCA (50 components) on our full dataset, trained a random forest classifier (scikit-learn, class_weight='balanced', max_depth=50) on the MTG labels, and then predicted labels for all cells. We labeled each cluster with the mode of its constituent cells if two conditions were met: more than 0.8 of predicted labels matched the mode, and the mean probability of these predictions was greater than 0.8."
